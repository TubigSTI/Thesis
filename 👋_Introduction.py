    Welcome to the **Business Viability Analysis Tool**, developed as part of our undergraduate thesis to assess 
    and predict the optimal locations for establishing Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Philippines.

    This tool combines **population demographics**, **Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)** data analytics, 
    and advanced machine learning techniques to support entrepreneurs and policymakers in making informed decisions. 
    By leveraging these insights, we aim to predict business viability and identify high-potential regions.

    ### Project Highlights:
    - **Population Data Analytics:** 
        - Analyze regional population density, growth rates, and demographic trends.
        - Understand how demographics influence market demand and regional opportunities.
    - **FIES Data Analytics:**
        - Examine household income, spending behaviors, and economic capacity across regions.
        - Provide insights into the purchasing power and needs of different communities.
    - **Clustering Algorithm with FA and PCA:** 
        - **Factor Analysis (FA):** Identifies underlying socio-economic dimensions such as household size, income, and basic needs.
        - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Reduces data complexity to focus on critical features affecting business viability.
        - Clustering groups regions into profiles (e.g., High Potential, Moderate Potential, and Low Potential) based on these factors.
    - **Business Score Prediction:**
        - Predict the viability score of specific business types (e.g., retail, food services, or logistics) for a given region.
        - Leverages FIES data, including income, expenditures, and socio-economic indicators, to estimate the business potential of an area.
        - Outputs actionable business scores that help identify the best locations for different types of enterprises.
    - **Actionable Insights:** 
        - Deliver region-specific recommendations based on market conditions, household capacity, and cluster profiles.

    ### Objective:
    The goal of this research is to create a **data-driven framework** that predicts the viability of specific business types 
    and identifies high-potential regions for SMEs. By combining population analytics, FIES data, clustering techniques, and machine learning, 
    this tool offers valuable insights for entrepreneurs and policymakers.
